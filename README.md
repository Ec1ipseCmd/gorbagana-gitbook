# What is Gorbagana?

## Keeping it simple

Gorbagana is a high-performance blockchain network forked from Solana's codebase, designed to combine meme culture energy with serious infrastructure capabilities, it's all trash!

Gorbagana flips the idea of a "trash chain" on its head:

Most chains are centralized, have insider MEV, and are exploitable to an extent.

Gorbagana embraces the centralization transparently and gives the power back to the community to use it for games, fun experiments, and fair on-chain mechanics.

## The technical trash

Built on Solana's proven architecture, Gorbagana inherits:

* **Proof of History (PoH) consensus** - Cryptographic clock for transaction ordering
* **Tower BFT** - Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance optimized for PoH
* **Turbine** - Block propagation protocol for fast network communication
* **Gulf Stream** - Mempool-less transaction forwarding
* **Sealevel** - Parallel smart contract runtime for high throughput
* **Pipelining** - Transaction processing optimization across validation stages

### Key Network Characteristics

* **Native Currency:** $GOR token
* **Transaction Speeds:** Sub-second finality with high throughput capacity
* **Smart Contract Support:** Full compatibility with Solana Program Library (SPL)
  * Soon to be Trash Program Library (TPL)
* **Block Time:** Expected to be lower than Solana from single network validator
* **Network Fees:** Minimal transaction costs paid in $GOR

### Current State

Gorbagana currently runs on **Testnet v1**â€”a stable, production-ready test environment processing real transactions while the team prepares for **Testnet v2 (Devnet)** and finally **Mainnet** launch. The network is expected to support full ecosystem functionality including token creation, DeFi protocols, and custom program deployment.

### The Vision

Gorbagana aims to prove that community-driven blockchain development can move faster and innovate more freely than traditional institutional approaches, all while maintaining the technical rigor needed for serious financial infrastructure.

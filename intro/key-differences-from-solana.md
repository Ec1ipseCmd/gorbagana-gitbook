# Key Differences from Solana

## What Makes It Different

While technically similar to Solana, Gorbagana operates as:

* **Community-governed network** with expected future decentralized decision making
* **Experimental playground** for rapid feature iteration
* **Meme-native ecosystem** that doesn't take itself too seriously
* **Builder-first environment** with streamlined development processes
* **Competition to Solana** to ensure the idea of 'Competition breeds excellence'

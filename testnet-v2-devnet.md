# Testnet v2 (Devnet)

## Migration to Testnet v2

### The Evolution: From Proof of Concept to Development Network

Testnet v1 served its purpose as a rapid proof of concept, successfully demonstrating that the Gorbagana fork was viable and could handle real transaction volume. With over 14 million transactions processed and valuable lessons learned, it's time for the next phase.

### Testnet v2: The Development Network

**Testnet v2 is now live** - a production-ready development environment designed specifically for builders preparing applications for mainnet launch.

#### Key Improvements in v2

* **Enhanced stability** for consistent development experiences
* **Optimized performance** based on v1 learnings
* **Developer-focused tooling** and better debugging capabilities
* **Mainnet-aligned architecture** for seamless migration
* **Robust infrastructure** to support growing ecosystem demand

### What This Means for Developers

**Testnet v2 is where serious development happens.** Unlike v1's experimental nature, v2 provides:

* Stable APIs and consistent behavior
* Reliable uptime for continuous development
* Testing environment that mirrors future mainnet conditions
* Support for complex application development and testing

### Migration Timeline

**Testnet v1 Decommissioning**: Legacy network being retired after successful testing\
**Testnet v2 Active**: Current development network running as Devnet\
**Mainnet Preparation**: v2 serves as the final testing ground before mainnet deployment

### Getting Started on Testnet v2

All current documentation and tooling points to Testnet v2. New developers should:

1. Connect to the current RPC endpoint: `https://rpc.gorbagana.wtf/`
2. Use Backpack wallet with custom RPC configuration
3. Begin building applications with confidence in network stability
4. Prepare for eventual mainnet migration

**Testnet v2 represents Gorbagana's transition from experimental project to serious blockchain infrastructure.**

# Testnet v1

### The Proof of Concept Era

Testnet v1 was born from pure necessity â€” a thrown together proof-of-concept network in the immediate aftermath of the incredible 24-hour sprint to get the network launched. After a few cracked developers successfully forked Solana and got the very first validator running, they needed a place for the community to access test what had been achieved.&#x20;

### What v1 accomplished

* **Validated the fork had worked** - In just 3 days, the newly forked chain had processed upwards of 14,000,000 transactions without any major issues.
* **Enabled early ecosystem development** - Gave the community and builders a playground to experiment with Gorbagana-native development.
* **Stress-testing infrastructure** - Allowed non-Solana developers access to understand the bottlenecks that may come and show optimizations that could be improved in future releases.
* **Proven community demand** - High transaction volume was enough to show real user interest beyond the meme coin.

### Learning and understanding the codebase

Testnet v1 served as a perfect testing ground to understand what needed to be improved upon for future releases.

* Wallet integration challenges
* Governance structure requirements
* Economic model refinements (How to handle Solana $GOR being bridged to the Gorbagana chain)
* Program deployment bottlenecks

### Mission Accomplished

With the release of Testnet v1, it had served its purpose perfectly. The network had processed more transactions than anybody had thought it would and attracted builders from all different ecosystems. Testnet v1 provided invaluable data for designing a smoother and easier accessible forked Solana blockchain, paving the way for a worry free deployment of Testnet v2 (Devnet) and Mainnet in the very near future.
